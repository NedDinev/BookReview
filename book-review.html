          <span>&quot;</span>The book is really amazing! I couldn't stop
          reading! Gripping plot with unexpected twists, convincing characters,
          amazing dialogues and tons of eternal life lessons. Many details
          creating the atmosphere of the epoch. Nice and moving reading!<span

          My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my
          infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit
          than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.
